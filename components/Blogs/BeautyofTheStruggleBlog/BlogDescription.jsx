              In 2019, Prometheus&apos; story began with its founder Lcid
              Fernandez being told by his mentors from various industries,
              including his father, that a social media marketing agency would
              never work in Western Visayas, much less Iloilo City. When he
              pitched his idea for seed capital, he was denied.
            </p>

            <p className="text-[#FFFFFF] sm:text-[28px]  font-ox">
              Undaunted, Lcid launched Prometheus from his bedroom with mostly
              DIY equipment. Then, he was simply Lcid the start-up founder,
              trying to get his digital marketing company off the ground in the
              middle of a pandemic.

              It was during this time as well that he rose to become the VP
              External of Daily Guardian, a regional daily newspaper. What was a
              traditional and conservative media outlet quickly became the most
              innovative media platform in the region. Combining both his roles
              as Prometheus CEO and Daily Guardian VP External, Lcid created
              several product lines and content series&apos; that modernized
              Daily Guardian&apos;s reporting, and introduced a storytelling
              platform that felt closer to its audiences.

            <p className="text-[#FFFFFF] sm:text-[28px]   font-ox">
              In this period, Daily Guardian&apos;s digital organic reach grew
              from 700 to over 10 million people monthly, with his work being
              recognized in his nomination as Newsmaker of the Year in the Globe
              Media Excellence Awards. Daily Guardian went on to be perennially
              recognized by its national and international colleagues for its
              innovative and responsible journalism.

            <p className="text-[#FFFFFF] sm:text-[28px]   font-ox">
              Almost five years later, Prometheus grew from its humble 3 digital
              marketers working out of a bedroom to a team of 50 idea engineers
              leading the industry in its locality. Prometheus has evolved from
              a digital marketing agency into becoming the only award-winning
              full-service marketing agency and public relations firm based in
              Western Visayas.

            <p className="text-[#FFFFFF] sm:text-[28px]   font-ox">
              The results that Prometheus has delivered have been recognized not
              just by its clients, but by the industry itself. Lcid is the first
              Ilonggo to ever win the Marketing Leader of the Year Award at the
              Marketing Excellence Awards (MEA) Philippines. In 2023 alone, he
              also received the following recognitions:

            Lcid&apos;s story is one of perseverance and defying limitations. He has
            always said, “The struggle to get from where you are to where you

            He has led the marketing revolution in Iloilo, evidenced by
            data-backed conversion strategies and industrial impact. His
            journey, born from rejection — serves as an inspiration — proving
            that success often lies beyond the comfort zone, waiting to be
            seized by those who dare to go through the struggle.
