<h2 className="text-[#FFFFFF] text-[18px] font-bold sm:text-[30px] pt-10 pb-2  "> Joining Prometheus</h2>

<p className="text-[#FFFFFF] text-[15px] sm:text-[28px] pb-5   ">
A. Frederick joined <a href="https://www.prometheus.ph/about" className="text-blue-500" > Promethes</a>, the first award-winning full-service marketing agency in Western Visayas.

<h2 className="text-[#FFFFFF] text-[18px] sm:text-[35px] font-bold pt-10 pb-1 ">WARPâ€™s Evolution and Growth</h2>

<p className="text-[#FFFFFF] text-[15px] sm:text-[28px] pb-5  sm:pb-10  ">
WARP was the first venture that Prometheus invested in, even before the marketing agency achieved its award-winning status. The collaboration between A. Frederick and Prometheus CEO <a href="https://www.prometheus.ph/blogs/beautyofstruggle" className="text-blue-500" > Lcid Fernandez</a> laid a strong foundation for WARP's digital marketing success.
<br/>
<br/>
In 2022, Lcid met up again with <a href="https://www.prometheus.ph/blogs/smartsolutions" className="text-blue-500" > Kevin Ryan Atutubo</a>, which turned out to be a really important moment. Lcid offered Kevin a partnership stake at WARP. This was a perfect match for Kevin's goal of driving global-standard technological advancements in the province through digital marketing.
