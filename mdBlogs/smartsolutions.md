Empowering Local Communities with Smart Solutions 
</h1>
<p className="text-[#FFFFFF] sm:text-[28px] pb-5  sm:pb-10">
Kevin Ryan Atutubo was working at a corporate job in Metro Manila when he decided to transition into full-service marketing. This yearning was not just a whim but a desire to harness the power of storytelling through cutting-edge software solutions.
<br/>
<br/>
In 2017, Kevin made a big change and moved back to his hometown, Iloilo City, to start working in marketing the way he imagined—by conveying great stories through websites and helping businesses grow online.

 </p>

Pivot to Full-Service Marketing
</h2>

<p className="text-[#FFFFFF] sm:text-[28px] pb-5  sm:pb-10 ">
Kevin quickly started his own company that focuses on digital marketing. He shared his knowledge by teaching software and becoming a thesis instructor at Central Philippine University's Software Engineering program.
</p>

<h2 className="text-[#FFFFFF] text-[16px] font-bold sm:text-[30px] pt-10 pb-5  "> Shaping the Locality</h2>

<p className="text-[#FFFFFF] sm:text-[28px] pb-5   ">
In 2018, Kevin joined the Global Shapers Iloilo. This group is made up of young people who want to make the world a better place, and they enabled Kevin to lead their technology efforts. That same year, he met Lcid Fernandez, who launched Prometheus, the leading full-service marketing agency and public relations firm in Western Visayas.
<br/> 
<br/>
A conversation about shared visions and goals forged a strong friendship and a future collaboration that would change Kevin’s career trajectory. When his business partners moved to Vietnam, Kevin made the big decision to stay in the Philippines.
</p>

<p className="text-[#FFFFFF] sm:text-[28px] pb-5  sm:pb-10  ">
  In this period, Daily Guardian's digital organic reach grew from 700 to over 10 million people monthly, with his work being recognized in his nomination as Newsmaker of the Year in the Globe Media Excellence Awards. Daily Guardian went on to be perennially recognized by its national and international colleagues for its innovative and responsible journalism.
</p>


<h2 className="text-[#FFFFFF] text-[16px] font-bold sm:text-[30px] pt-10 pb-5 sm:pb-10 ">Engineering a Marketing Legacy</h2>

<p className="text-[#FFFFFF] sm:text-[28px] pb-5  sm:pb-10  ">
In 2022, Kevin met up again with Lcid, which turned out to be a really important moment. Lcid offered Kevin with a partnership stake at WARP, a company part of Prometheus that focuses on web development and software solutions. This was a perfect match for Kevin's skills and his dream of running a full-service marketing in Iloilo.
<br/>
<br/>
Kevin decided to join WARP. At first, it was just him and A Frederick Molejona Sansait working there, but he was given the opportunity to grow the team and manage more projects. By the end of the year, the team had grown from two people to five.
</p>

<p className="text-[#FFFFFF] sm:text-[28px] pb-5  sm:pb-10">
Today, in 2024, WARP has grown to a team of 20 people and is about to launch its largest project yet. Under Kevin’s leadership as Chief Technical Officer, WARP is set to become a beacon of technological innovation in Iloilo with its streamlined solutions for government services.
<br/>
<br/>
Kevin’s journey from a corporate job in Manila to Iloilo’s leading agency in full-service marketing is a testament to the power of returning home and reinventing one’s career path. It highlights the potential for local talent to drive global-standard technological advancements, proving that significant industry shifts can indeed start in one’s own home.
<br/>
<br/>
Now, WARP has grown to a team of fifteen people and is about to start its biggest project ever. Kevin, as the Chief Technical Officer, has shaped WARP to become a leader in technology in Iloilo.
<br/>
<br/>
Kevin's story shows how moving back home and starting over in his career turned out to be a great decision. He moved from a corporate job in Manila to lead a top marketing agency in Iloilo. This shows that you can achieve great things right where you are, using local skills to meet global standards.
