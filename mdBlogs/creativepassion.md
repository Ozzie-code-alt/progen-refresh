    Your comfort zone is a place where doubts, fears, and what-ifs swirl like a storm, holding you back from your dreams. Yet, it’s also where growth, achievement, and transformation lie waiting for those bold enough to step forward.
<br/>
<br/>
As a Creative Director at Prometheus, the first and only award-winning marketing agency in Western Visayas, Benjamin Austin Pe’s journey is a testament to perseverance, passion, and the power of creating opportunities.
<br/>
<br/>His journey began at St. Paul University Iloilo, where he earned his degree in BSBA Marketing Management. Graduating with a keen interest in brand design and development, he embarked on a career that saw him working with over a hundred brands, organizations, and individuals since 2016. His roles varied from freelance clientele and consultancy to corporate and agency positions, each adding a unique layer to his expertise.

    Discovering Passion in Hospitality and Events
  </h2>

  <p className="text-[#FFFFFF] text-[15px] sm:text-[28px] pb-5 sm:pb-10">
His passion for marketing grew in the hospitality and events industries, where Benj worked with renowned local and international hotel brands. Additionally, he contributed to local high-profile live events like Iloilo Dinagyang and Iloilo Live Events Alliance. 
<br/>
<br/>
However, finding consistent opportunities in Iloilo City was challenging due to the nascent state of the marketing industry there.

Trailblazing his Own Path in Branding and Marketing
  </h2>

  <p className="text-[#FFFFFF] text-[15px] sm:text-[28px] pb-5 sm:pb-10">
In response to the limited opportunities, Benj co-founded a small brand studio, Deuce Brand Studio. Starting with just one laptop and an external hard drive in a makeshift office, they provided branding services for local brands and personalities.
<br/>
<br/>
Benj and his co-founder actively self-studied and enrolled in various courses and workshops to improve their skills. They seized every opportunity to survive, from lecturing students on parliamentary debate and resumé making to judging pageants and photography contests.

Rising Through Challenges
  </h2>

  <p className="text-[#FFFFFF] text-[15px] sm:text-[28px] pb-5 sm:pb-10">
In 2019, Benj’s career took a significant turn when he joined an international hotel in Iloilo City as a Graphic Artist. He was part of a two-person marketing team responsible for social media, production, media, graphics, videos, and live events. Simultaneously, he collaborated with a team on rebranding the Dinagyang Festival, contributing to the festival’s shift to contemporary and digital.
<br/>
<br/>

Despite the demanding workload, Benj was promoted to OIC Marketing Coordinator at Courtyard by Marriott Iloilo. However, the pandemic brought new challenges, leading to the dissolution of the Deuce in 2021.

Next Generation of Marketing Creatives in Iloilo
  </h2>
  <p className="text-[#FFFFFF] text-[15px] sm:text-[28px] pb-5 sm:pb-10">
In 2021, Benj joined Prometheus as a Senior Graphic Artist. He was quickly promoted to Art Director in the same year, and became Creative Director in 2023. With this new role, Benj faced challenges that tested his adaptability and leadership. Yet, it was these constraints that fueled his creativity and led to specific, measurable, and impactful solutions for the marketing agency’s clients.
<br/>
<br/>
At Prometheus, Benj found a team of like-minded individuals and the right resources to make a significant impact in the marketing industry within Iloilo City.

The Ethos of Constant Learning
  </h2>
  <p className="text-[#FFFFFF] text-[15px] sm:text-[28px] pb-5 sm:pb-10">
Benj’s career has always been about breaking through limits and believing in the power of continuous learning. As a young graphic artist, he viewed new challenges as a stepping stone for growth. His early experiences were marked by an eagerness to adapt and transform obstacles into opportunities for development.
<br/>
<br/>
Now, as Creative Director with a wealth of marketing expertise, Benj chose to stay outside the bustling metro to create opportunities and pioneer a marketing revolution in the region. More than his personal success, he is committed to supporting and empowering his team as he pays forward to the support he received. 
<br/>
<br/>
For Benj, true success lies not just in individual achievements but in the legacy of inspiration and growth he leaves behind.
<br/>
<br/>
“Big wins cannot happen without the small ones, and that's where we learn the most important lessons. Without grinding through the uncomfortable, we cannot appreciate growth,” he said.
<br/>
<br/>
Benj’s journey is far from over, but with his unwavering belief and vision, the future holds exciting possibilities for Benj and the marketing landscape of Iloilo City.
