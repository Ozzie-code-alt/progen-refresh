Think of Western Visayas, and bustling streets of Iloilo City or the pristine beaches of Boracay come to mind. But the region holds an often-overlooked treasure - the Fourth District of Iloilo. Despite its captivating history, vibrant culture, and stunning nature, this area faced significant challenges in gaining recognition and attracting visitors. That's why Prometheus launched the Bugal sang Kwarto Distrito campaign.
</p>

<p className="text-[#FFFFFF] sm:text-[28px]  pb-10 ">
The Bugal Sang Kwarto Distrito campaign aimed to empower locals to become ambassadors for their region, leveraging their deep knowledge and passion for their hometowns. By harnessing the concept of revenge tourism and tapping into the strength of word-of-mouth marketing within the close-knit community of Panay Island, the campaign sought to create mass awareness and curiosity among potential travelers.
</p>

<p className="text-[#FFFFFF] sm:text-[28px]  pb-10 ">
The campaign employed a multi-faceted approach to reach and engage with potential travelers. A user-friendly website, Bugal Sang Kwarto Distrito, served as a central hub for information on the Fourth District's attractions, accommodations, and local experiences, providing visitors with easy access to all the necessary details they needed to plan their trip effectively.

            Online to showcase tourism highlights, events, and activities within
            the Fourth District, increasing its visibility and appeal.
</p>

<p className="text-[#FFFFFF] sm:text-[28px]  pb-10 ">

<p className="text-[#FFFFFF] sm:text-[28px]  pb-10 ">
         The campaign propelled Prometheus into the national spotlight as the
            Bugal sang Kwarto Distrito campaign earned a nomination in the
            Excellence in Public Sector/Non-Profit Marketing category at the
            Marketing Excellence Awards 2023.

            empowerment of locals and the strategic utilization of digital
